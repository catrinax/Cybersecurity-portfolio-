This is a repository to record my journey to build an entry-level cybersecurity portfolio.
I am a highly self-motivated cybersecurity professional with strong analytical skills and a great sense of responsibilities to help organizations and individuals protect their digital assets. Combining a solid foundation in cybersecurity tools and frameworks with a clear and transparent communication style, I am committed to maximize organizationâ€™s resilience to cyber crimes and capability in cybersecurity compliance.
